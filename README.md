## Overview
### Description
Hosting an event or party requires a lot of effort, thinking and coordination and when a group of people organize an event there is confusion about whoâ€™s in charge of what and when. Also during massive events like BGR, students come across various events around campus and since there is no central  platform which organizes and lists all the event dates and details, students tend to miss events due to forgetfulness or time conflict. Happening Place is an app which allows you to effectively host events by allowing multiple members to simultaneously plan for a single event without any hassle. It also allows users to find relevant events around them. Though several event-finding apps such as EventBrite, which lists nearby events, exist none of them offer the feature of multiple users planning and contributing to a single event which enables workload distribution.
